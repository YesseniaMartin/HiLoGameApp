# Hi/Lo Game


### Description
This program is to play against a computer and guess the correct number. The program will notify you if your guess was to high to low when you enter your guess. This program also gives you a max of 5 ties for round, if you run out of tries the computer will prompt you and ask if you would like to play again by typing yes or no. The game will continue until the user exits the game.  

### Technologies Used
For this program to work, we need a Scanner(System.in) to read the user input.
While loop to make the program run again when needing to start the guessing game all over again.
A for loop to run as many times as you need it.
We would also need a Math.random() to generate a random number the computer wants you to guess.
If else statement would be used to meet the condition when the user enters a number and compare it to math.random generated number.
We would need a boolean to determine if the player would like to play again, and re-enter the for loop again.

### Lesson Learned# HiLoGameApp
Make sure to follow the user story before moving on to the next story. The code can be confusing if you don't follow each step and finish one first before completing the next story of the program. 
The user "will" know that we need to enter a numbers unless prompt other wise, this time our user understand and follower directions to the letter, what an amazing user :)

Thank you for playing, have fun!
